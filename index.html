                <h3>Astrophysics Fellow (Summer Research Fellowship Program) at SARSTEM</h4>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> July 17, 2021 – September 25, 2021</p>
                <p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Constraints on the Variable Chaplygin Gas Model from Gravitational Wave Merger Events</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                <p>Scientific observations often challenge and refine existing theories. One such groundbreaking observation was of Type Ia supernovae. While numerous cosmological models attempt to explain the universe's expansion, the Variable Chaplygin Gas model stands out. This model transitions from a dust-dominated era to a quintessence-dominated era and aligns well with current Type Ia Supernovae data. In this project, we constrained the parameters of the Variable Chaplygin Gas model by analyzing supernova events and gravitational wave events across different redshifts.</p>

                <h3>Project Student at GMRT (Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope)</h4>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> November 1, 2019 – April 30, 2020 (Certificate not available)</p>
                <p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Analysis of Matched Frequency Data from Legacy and Upgraded GMRT</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                <p>Collaborating with Prof. Ishwar Chandra from NCRA, this project involved creating and analyzing images from 100 datasets selected from GMRT archival data. Using the Common Astronomy Software Application (CASA), I worked on these datasets to produce images, modifying the provided pipeline to optimize processing time. During the analysis, I detected an unusual Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) in one of the backend datasets, which did not appear in the other. This peculiar RFI, observed to shift its position within the frequency domain, was reported and investigated by GMRT engineers, with my involvement to understand its origin.</p>

                <h3>Construction of a Radio JOVE Receiver (MSc Second Year Project)</h4>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                <p>During my second year of MSc, I built a Radio JOVE receiver using a design by Jim Rowe, which is an improved and cost-effective version of NASA’s original design. NASA's version contained many obsolete and expensive components, making Rowe’s design more practical. I successfully assembled the receiver from scratch and fine-tuned it using a signal generator at 20 MHz.</p>
