                <h2>The Expanding Universe — Our Endless Journey</h2>
    <p>Posted on <time datetime="2025-10-25">July 10, 2025</time></p>
    <img src="https://study.com/cimages/videopreview/zizrjtk0jk.jpg" alt="Redshift illustration showing stretched light waves.">
    
    <p>Galaxy distances unlocked, Edwin Hubble peered deeper in the 1920s from California's Mount Wilson. Born in 1889, this Missouri farm boy-turned-basketball star ditched law for stars, wielding the world's biggest telescope. He classified "nebulae" as distant galaxies, then measured their speeds via spectra—rainbow fingerprints of light. What he found? Mind-blowing: All but neighbors recede, and faster ones are farther. The universe isn't static—it's ballooning!</p>
    
    <h3>Hubble’s Law</h3>
    
    <p>Key clue: Redshift. Approaching objects blueshift (wavelengths squeeze); receding ones redshift (stretch to red end), like a siren's wail dropping as it zooms away. Hubble clocked redshifts for 18 galaxies using Leavitt's Cepheids. Plot distance vs. speed: Straight line! Hubble's Law: Velocity = Hubble Constant (H0) x Distance. H0 ≈70 km/s/Mpc means for every megaparsec (3 million light-years) farther, galaxies flee 70 km/s faster. Implication? Space itself expands, carrying galaxies like raisins in rising dough—no center, everything stretches uniformly.</p>
    
    <img src="https://cdn.numerade.com/ask_images/3ae288ec502a4ecf987c3c337bb2541e.jpg" alt="Balloon with dots moving apart as it inflates.">
    
    <p>Hubble's 1929 paper sparked the Big Bang theory (coined mockingly by Fred Hoyle in 1949). Georges Lemaître, a Belgian priest-physicist, predicted it in 1927—now it's Hubble-Lemaître Law. Fun fact: Hubble smoked cigars atop his scope; one 1930s photo shows ash nearly scorching a priceless photo plate!</p>
    
    <h3>Modern Mapping</h3>
    
    <p>Today, Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) scans one-third the sky with a New Mexico telescope, cataloging 500 million objects since 2000. It maps the "cosmic web": Filaments of galaxies threading voids, like a 3D spiderweb of dark matter and gas, spanning 93 billion light-years observable. SDSS revealed galaxy evolution—early universe was clumpier. But tension brews: Different methods give H0 as 67 or 74 km/s/Mpc, hinting new physics like evolving dark energy.</p>
    
    <h3>The Mystery Lives On</h3>
    
    <p>Gravitational waves from merging black holes now act as "standard sirens," rippling spacetime to measure distances sans light. Will it solve the Hubble Tension? Maybe you will—future scopes like Euclid hunt the web's secrets. The universe expands at 70 km/s per Mpc, born 13.8 billion years ago, still growing. We're on a cosmic road trip, and the road's lengthening!</p>
    
    <h3>Activity: The Balloon Universe</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Inflate a balloon slightly; dot "galaxies" with marker, measure distances.</li>
        <li>Blow more; all dots recede, farther ones fastest—no center!</li>
        <li>Draw "light waves" stretching between dots (redshift).</li>
        <li>Calculate "H0": Speed/distance ratio stays constant.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Watch how distance grows faster between farther dots. You're inflating your own Big Bang model!</p>

                <h2>Cosmic Candles — Measuring the Galaxies</h2>
    <p>Posted on <time datetime="2025-10-25">June 10, 2025</time></p>
    <img src="https://www.azoquantum.com/images/Article_Images/ImageForArticle_436_16875340187622576.jpg" alt="HR diagram showing color vs. brightness.">
    
    <p>Parallax taps out at our galaxy's edge—too faint for farther. To map intergalactic voids, astronomers needed "standard candles": objects with known true brightness, like 100-watt bulbs anywhere. Spot one, gauge how dim it looks (fainter = farther), and boom—distance! Light dims with the square of distance (double away, quarter bright), so math reveals the gap. But finding reliable candles? That's where trailblazers like Henrietta Swan Leavitt shine.</p>
    
    <h3>The Brightness Trick</h3>
    
    <p>Imagine streetlights: Same bulb power, but the farthest looks tiniest. Stars work similarly, but vary wildly in "wattage" (luminosity). Solution: Pick ones with a secret code linking pulse to power. Enter Cepheids—pulsating stars that swell and shrink like breathing giants, brightening/dimming every 1-100 days. Brighter ones pulse slower; plot period vs. peak brightness, and you calibrate the candle.</p>
    
    <h3>The Cepheid Secret</h3>
    
    <p>Born in 1868, Henrietta was a "computer" at Harvard—women crunched data for male bosses, paid peanuts. In 1908, she cataloged blurry photos, spotting 1,777 variable stars in the Magellanic Clouds (our galaxy's satellite dwarfs). By 1912, studying 25 Cepheids there, she graphed: Longer blink = brighter intrinsic shine. "A simple relation," she wrote humbly, but it was revolutionary! All Cepheids at same distance (in the Clouds), so she nailed their yardstick. Edwin Hubble later used it on Andromeda, proving it's a separate galaxy 2.5 million light-years away—not a nebula.</p>
    
    <p>Fun fact: Delta Cephei, the type's namesake, pulses 5.4 days. Leavitt discovered half the known variables then, despite no telescope time. Her period-luminosity law (now Leavitt's Law) scaled the universe to billions of light-years. Today, Hubble and James Webb scopes hunt Cepheids for cosmic tape measures.</p>
    
    <p>By comparing true vs. apparent brightness, we mapped galaxy clusters. Cepheids lit the way from Milky Way to mega-structures!</p>
    
    <h3>Activity: Light Layers</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Grab a bright bulb or phone flashlight in a dark room.</li>
        <li>Measure its "brightness" (wall glow) at 1 meter.</li>
        <li>Add tissue layers or move farther; note dimming (inverse square law: distance x2, brightness /4).</li>
        <li>Predict a "Cepheid" by timing flashlight blinks—longer "pulse" = "brighter" assumed power.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <img src="https://pages.uoregon.edu/soper/StarLife/cepheid1.gif" alt="Light curve of a Cepheid variable star showing brightness vs. time.">
    
    <p>That’s how distance dims light—the same principle that built the galactic scale. You're now a cosmic surveyor!</p>

               <h2>Beyond the Sun — Measuring Stars</h2>
    <p>Posted on <time datetime="2025-10-25">May 10, 2025</time></p>
    <p>With the solar system mapped to scale, astronomers got ambitious: How far to the stars? Our Sun's just one pinprick in a sky of billions. Stars are so distant, light takes years (or millennia) to reach us. Enter parallax—the ultimate cosmic tape measure, using Earth's orbit as a baseline. It's like holding your thumb up and winking eye-to-eye; the thumb "jumps" against the background. For stars, Earth is the eyes, six months apart (300 million km baseline). The closer the star, the bigger the shift. But those shifts? Tinier than a pixel on your phone screen.</p>
    
    <img src="https://lco.global/images/S5qjLVRTXP0daCCQwb8gYvdIpGM=/308/width-400/parallax-diagram-800x451.jpg" alt="Earth’s orbit showing two viewing positions six months apart.">
    
    <h3>The Parallax Method</h3>
    
    <p>Ancient Greeks dreamed of parallax but couldn't spot it—stars seemed fixed. Galileo tried with his new telescope in 1610 but failed; tech wasn't sharp enough. By the 1800s, better scopes sparked a race. Enter Friedrich Bessel, a German math whiz born in 1784. Self-taught astronomer, he targeted 61 Cygni, a "flying star" that zipped across the sky. From 1837-1838, Bessel measured its position obsessively, calculating a parallax of 0.31 arcseconds (1/10,000th a degree—like spotting a firefly in New York from LA). That pegged it at 11 light-years away—first star distance ever! Fun fact: Bessel also predicted Neptune's existence and measured Sirius's wobble, hinting at an invisible "dark" companion (a white dwarf, confirmed later).</p>
    
    <p>Parallax maxes at about 1,000 light-years; beyond, shifts are invisible. But it proved stars are suns like ours, scattered in a vast "Milky Way" disk. Today, ESA's Gaia satellite has mapped 2 billion stars' parallaxes, revealing our galaxy's 3D shape. Proxima Centauri, nearest at 4.2 light-years, shifts just 0.77 arcseconds—imagine measuring a coin's width on the Moon!</p>
    
    <h3>The First Success</h3>
    
    <p>Bessel's win in 1838 beat rivals like Thomas Henderson (who measured Alpha Centauri secretly in 1832 but published late). It shattered the idea of a small universe, showing stars are neighbors in a huge stellar city. Parallax isn't just history—it's how we hunt exoplanets and map cosmic neighborhoods.</p>
    
    <h3>Activity: Thumb Trick</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Stretch your arm, thumb up, against a distant wall poster.</li>
        <li>Close one eye, then the other—thumb "shifts" versus background.</li>
        <li>Bring thumb closer; shift grows—like a nearby star!</li>
        <li>Measure angles with a protractor for "parallax angle." Farther thumb = smaller angle, like dim stars.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>That’s the same principle astronomers use to measure stars. Your hand just spanned light-years!</p>

              <h2>Locking the Scale — The Astronomical Unit</h2>
    <p>Posted on <time datetime="2025-10-25">March 10, 2025</time></p>
    <p>Kepler nailed the shapes of planetary orbits—squished ellipses, not circles—but he had no ruler for their size. Imagine drawing a map without knowing if the lines are miles or millimeters. Astronomers needed a "gold standard" distance: from Earth to the Sun, now called 1 Astronomical Unit (AU), about 150 million km. Locking this scale unlocked the solar system's true size. Enter epic sky events and clever timing that turned dreams into measurements.</p>
    
    <img src="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/519784/530468/Sun_VT/4bde7053-0c79-4222-8270-fb103ca45385?t=1475660086131" alt="Venus passing across the Sun as seen from two Earth positions.">
    
    <h3>The Transit of Venus</h3>
    
    <p>Every 105-121 years, Venus zips between Earth and Sun, appearing as a tiny black dot crawling across the Sun's face—like a bug on a lightbulb. It's called a transit, and it happens in pairs eight years apart. In 1716, comet-chasing genius Edmond Halley (of Halley's Comet fame) had a brainstorm: Watch the transit from different Earth spots, note slight timing differences, and use geometry like Eratosthenes did for Earth's size. The farther apart observers, the bigger the parallax shift, revealing the Sun's distance.</p>
    
    <p>Halley died before the 1761 transit, but his idea sparked global teamwork. Kings funded expeditions—Captain Cook sailed to Tahiti for the 1769 show, dodging pirates and storms. Over 150 scientists worldwide timed Venus's 6-hour crawl with stopwatches and telescopes. Indian observatories in Madras joined in! Crunching the numbers (with some errors from Venus's fuzzy edges), they pegged 1 AU at about 153 million km—spot-on for the era. Fun fact: The next transit duo is in 2117 and 2125. Mark your calendars... or your great-great-grandkids'!</p>
    
    <h3>Measuring the Speed of Light</h3>
    
    <p>With 1 AU in hand, Danish astronomer Ole Rømer turned it into a speed gun for light in 1676. He timed eclipses of Jupiter's moon Io, which dips into Jupiter's shadow every 42 hours like clockwork. But when Earth was on the far side of its orbit (300 million km extra from Jupiter), eclipses lagged by 16-22 minutes. Rømer realized: Light takes time to travel! That delay covered twice 1 AU, so light zips 220,000 km/s—close to today's 300,000 km/s. Before Rømer, folks thought light was instant. He proved the universe has speed limits, kickstarting physics revolutions.</p>
    
    <p>These feats showed science thrives on patience and collaboration. Today, radar bounces off Venus for pinpoint AU accuracy, but transits remind us: Rare events can measure the cosmos.</p>
    
    <h3>Activity: Torch and Coin Timing</h3>
    
    <p>You’ll need: A coin, a torch, a stopwatch.</p>
    
    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Shine the torch at a wall from 1 meter away.</li>
        <li>Swiftly pass the coin through the beam to cast a moving shadow; time the crossing.</li>
        <li>Double the distance (torch farther); time again—shadow moves slower!</li>
        <li>Calculate "light delay" like Rømer: Longer path = longer time. Scale up to cosmic distances.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Even tiny timing differences can tell big distances! Who knew a coin could mimic Jupiter's moons?</p>

                <h2>Kepler’s Genius — Mapping the Solar System</h2>
    <p>Posted on <time datetime="2025-10-25">February 10, 2025</time></p>
    
    <p>Picture this: It's the early 1600s, and the night sky is a giant puzzle. People thought planets zipped around the Sun in perfect circles, like marbles on a track. But one determined guy, Johannes Kepler, spent years crunching numbers and staring at stars to crack the code. Born in 1571 in Germany, Kepler was a skinny kid with bad eyesight and a love for math. He dreamed of becoming a pastor but got hooked on astronomy after seeing a comet streak across the sky as a teen. Fast forward to 1600, and he's assisting the famous (and kinda quirky) astronomer Tycho Brahe.</p>
    
    <p>Tycho was a Danish nobleman with a golden nose—literally! He lost part of his real nose in a duel and wore a fancy replacement. Tycho built an island observatory called Uraniborg, like a cosmic castle, and spent 20 years tracking planets with super-precise tools (no telescopes yet). He measured Mars's position night after night, creating the best data ever. But Tycho believed Earth was the center of everything, not the Sun. When he died suddenly in 1601 (legend says from a burst bladder after holding his pee too long at a party), he left his mountain of notes to Kepler, his young assistant. Kepler called it his "treasure"—and it changed everything.</p>
    
    <h3>The Mars Trick</h3>
    
    <p>Kepler dove into Tycho's Mars data like a detective on a case. Mars is tricky because its orbit crosses Earth's, making it look like it's doing loop-de-loops in the sky (called retrograde motion). Kepler compared Mars's position every 687 days—that's one Mars year. Since Mars returns to the same spot, but Earth has lapped it, he could back-calculate Earth's position. It was like using Mars as a mirror to see our own orbit. After thousands of calculations (by hand—no computers!), Kepler realized circles didn't fit. He tried ovals, but only ellipses worked perfectly. Boom—Kepler's First Law: Planets orbit the Sun in ellipses, with the Sun at one focus, like an egg's stretched circle.</p>
    
    <p>But wait, there's more! Kepler's Second Law says a planet sweeps equal areas in equal times. When close to the Sun, it speeds up—like a kid on a swing flying faster at the bottom. Farther out, it slows down. And his Third Law? The time a planet takes to orbit (its year) squared equals its average distance from the Sun cubed. Math magic that predicts orbits for all planets!</p>
    
    <h3>The Big Discovery</h3>
    
    <p>It took Kepler eight years of "painful math" (his words) to publish his laws in 1609 and 1619. These weren't just facts—they smashed the old Earth-centered model and backed Copernicus's Sun-centered one. Fun fact: Kepler was also an astrologer (stars influencing personalities) and wrote a sci-fi story about a trip to the Moon. His work paved the way for Newton to figure out gravity. Today, we use Kepler's laws for everything from satellite launches to exoplanet hunts. NASA's Kepler telescope (2009-2018) discovered over 2,600 worlds beyond our solar system!</p>
    
    <h3>Activity: Draw Elliptical Orbits</h3>
    
    <p>You’ll need: Paper, pencil, string, and two pins.</p>
    
    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Push two pins close together—these are the “foci.” (One's the Sun!)</li>
        <li>Tie the string into a loop and loop it around both pins.</li>
        <li>Keep the string taut with the pencil and draw around—you'll make an ellipse.</li>
        <li>Try different pin distances or string lengths for squished or round orbits. Label planets and see how close ones are more oval.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Et3OdzEGX_w/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="How to draw an ellipse using pins and string.">
    
    <p>That's how Kepler uncovered the solar system's true dance—elliptical, speedy, and totally awesome. Next time you look up, remember: the planets are grooving to his beat!</p>

                <h2>Earth, Moon, and the Sun’s Great Secret</h2>
    <p>Posted on <time datetime="2025-10-25">November 10, 2025</time></p>
    <p>Once Earth’s size was known, another Greek scientist, Aristarchus of Samos, looked up and asked,</p>
    
    <p>“If I know how big Earth is, can I find how far the Moon and Sun are?”</p>
    
    <img src="https://compote.slate.com/images/bcf82fa1-d9dc-451f-a155-a4ab70835542.jpg?crop=590%2C412%2Cx0%2Cy0" alt="Earth’s shadow falling on the Moon during a lunar eclipse.">
    
    <h3>Measuring the Moon’s Distance</h3>
    
    <p>Aristarchus studied lunar eclipses — when Earth blocks sunlight and its round shadow falls on the Moon.</p>
    
    <p>He noticed that Earth’s shadow looked about 2.5 times wider than the Moon itself.</p>
    
    <p>He also timed how long the Moon took to pass through the shadow — about 3 hours.</p>
    
    <p>Since the Moon takes 27 days to complete one orbit, he used geometry and ratios to compare how far it moved during those 3 hours versus its whole orbit.</p>
    
    <p>Using the known size of Earth, he worked out that the Moon must be about 60 Earth radii away.</p>
    
    <p>Modern value: 60.3 Earth radii. Amazing accuracy without telescopes!</p>
    
    <img src="https://www.mos.org/sites/default/files/styles/max_width_2400/public/2025-01/lunar_eclipse_credit_timeanddatedotcom.png?itok=KnTVCq-Y" alt="Geometry showing Earth, Moon, and shadow width during eclipse.">
    
    <h3>Finding the Sun’s Distance</h3>
    
    <p>Next, Aristarchus turned to the half-moon phase.</p>
    
    <p>When the Moon looks exactly half lit, the Sun, Earth, and Moon make a right triangle.</p>
    
    <p>If he could measure the angle between the Sun and Moon, he could find how far away the Sun was.</p>
    
    <img src="https://homework.study.com/cimages/multimages/16/diagram_450x156856155143634057.png" alt="Right triangle formed by Earth, Moon, and Sun during half-moon phase.">
    
    <p>The trouble was that the angle was very small — less than 1°. His eyes weren’t precise enough.</p>
    
    <p>He thought the Sun was 20 times farther than the Moon. In truth, it’s about 370 times!</p>
    
    <p>Still, Aristarchus made a bold leap: since the Sun was so large, it must be the center and Earth must move around it.</p>
    
    <p>That was the first heliocentric model — nearly 1,800 years before Copernicus!</p>
    
    <h3>Activity: Shadow and Coin Experiment</h3>
    
    <p>You’ll need:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>A coin</li>
        <li>A torch or candle</li>
        <li>A wall or screen</li>
        <li>A ruler</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Steps:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Place the torch on a table, pointing at the wall.</li>
        <li>Hold the coin in front of it to make a circular shadow.</li>
        <li>Move the coin closer or farther and note how the shadow changes size.</li>
        <li>Use a ruler to measure distances and shadow diameters.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>You’ve just learned how light and shadow reveal distance — the same idea Aristarchus used to measure the heavens!</p>

                <h2>How Far Is Far? The Incredible Story of Measuring the Earth</h2>
    <p>Posted on <time datetime="2025-10-25">September 10, 2025</time></p>
    <p>Imagine standing outside on a sunny afternoon. You look at your shadow. Now imagine someone else, far away, doing the same thing — and their shadow is a little different!</p>
    
    <p>Would you believe that this tiny difference helped a man 2,000 years ago measure the entire size of the Earth?</p>
    
    <p>Let’s travel back to ancient Egypt, around 250 BC. A wise man named Eratosthenes worked in the great library of Alexandria.</p>
    
    <img src="https://hapax.github.io/images/posts/erat1.png" alt="Eratosthenes experiment: Sunlight hitting Earth at Alexandria and Syene with shadows at different angles.">
    
    <h3>The Clue from a Deep Well</h3>
    
    <p>Eratosthenes had heard that in Syene (now Aswan), on the day of the summer solstice, the Sun stood straight overhead. Sunlight fell straight into a deep well — no shadow at all!</p>
    
    <p>But in Alexandria, far to the north, a stick still made a small shadow at the same time.</p>
    
    <p>He thought, “If sunlight falls at different angles, the Earth must be curved!”</p>
    
    <h2>Measuring with Shadows</h2>
    
    <p>At noon on the solstice, he placed a stick (a gnomon) upright in the ground and measured the shadow.</p>
    
    <p>The Sun’s rays were tilted by about 7.2°, which is 1/50th of a full circle (360°).</p>
    
    <p>The distance between Alexandria and Syene was about 800 km.</p>
    
    <p>So, if 7.2° equals 800 km, the whole circle (360°) must be:</p>
    
    <p>360 × 800 ÷ 7.2 = 40,000 km.</p>
    
    <p>That’s almost the real circumference of Earth — measured 2,000 years ago with only a stick and sunlight!</p>
    
    <img src="https://physics.weber.edu/palen/clearinghouse/labs/Skywatch/CelestialNavigation1_files/image004.jpg" alt="Measuring the shadow angle with a stick (gnomon) and the Sun.">
    
    <h3>A Real Indian Example: Chennai and Jaipur</h3>
    
    <p>Let’s try the same idea with two Indian cities!</p>
    
    <p>Chennai’s latitude ≈ 13° N</p>
    
    <p>Jaipur’s latitude ≈ 27° N</p>
    
    <p>Latitude difference = 14°</p>
    
    <p>Distance between them ≈ 1,600 km (straight-line flight distance is about 1,607 km).</p>
    
    <p>If 14° = 1,600 km, then the full 360° = 360 × 1,600 ÷ 14 = 41,140 km.</p>
    
    <p>That’s very close to the real 40,075 km!</p>
    
    <p>Earth’s diameter = 41,140 ÷ π ≈ 13,090 km (Real = 12,742 km).</p>
    
    <p>Pretty good for simple math and sunlight! (Using the more precise 1,607 km distance: circumference ≈ 41,323 km, diameter ≈ 13,153 km — still impressively accurate!)</p>

    <h3>Activity: Measure Earth’s Diameter</h3>
    
    <p>You’ll need:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>A straight stick (1 m)</li>
        <li>A ruler and protractor</li>
        <li>A watch or phone clock</li>
        <li>A friend in another city</li>
        <li>Google Maps to measure distance</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Steps:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>On the same date and time (solar noon), fix your stick upright on flat ground.</li>
        <li>Measure the length of its shadow.</li>
        <li>Calculate the Sun’s angle: angle = arctan(shadow ÷ stick height).</li>
        <li>Ask your friend to do the same.</li>
        <li>Find the difference in the Sun’s angle between both places.</li>
        <li>Use this formula: Earth’s circumference = 360 × distance ÷ angle difference.</li>
        <li>Divide by π to get diameter.</li>
    </ol>

                <p>सवाल:</p> 
                    <p>दिवसा ढवळ्या मुक्काम करूनी बाहेर पडतो रात्रीला, कोण असा गं फिरे प्रवासी दिवा बांधुनी पाठीला.</p>
                    <p>काय असेल याच ऊत्तर. कोणता असा प्रवासी असेळ जो दिवा पाठीलाच बांधून फिरतो.</p>
                        <p>असे बरेच जीव आहेत जे असा दिवा घेऊन येतात जन्माला. त्यापैकी सुपरिचित असलेला एक म्हणजे काजवा. आणि असे मला माहित असलेले जीव म्हणजे प्लवके, मासे, शैवाल, बुरशा. यातल्या काही मोजक्याच प्राजाती चमकतात (सगळे चमकत असते तर रात्री जग काही वेगळंच दिसलं असतं).
                        या जीवांच्या चमकण्यामागचं काय प्रयोजन असेल? या काही प्रजातींनी चमकन का निवडलं असेल? अंधारात चमकल्याने त्यांना शिकारी प्राण्यांपासून धोका नसेल का?</p>
                        <p>चला आज समजण्याचा प्रयत्न करूया. </p>

                <p>चित्रपट: आई (१९८१) </p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFRLEBoFbgA"> गाणं: विपरीत सारं घडलं गं </a>

                     <h2>Plastic Mulch, a bad choice?</h2>
                     <p>Posted on <time datetime="2022-09-15">September 15, 2022</time></p>

                     <p>I was looking at old Google Earth images of my village and found one from 2018. The white areas in the fields are <strong>plastic mulch</strong>, which we farmers use to increase crop yields. But another picture shows our problem with getting rid of this plastic. The mulch is a <strong>25-micron plastic film</strong>, and each acre needs 5-6 bundles, each weighing about 10 kg. If you search for my village, Rohokadi, and the surrounding area in the historical data, you’ll see the issue farmers might face soon. While plastic mulch has helped us grow better crops for the past 8-10 years, we are starting to notice some problems. Even though the mulch can be used for three crops in a row, most farmers only use it once and then throw it away. Over time, this plastic stops air from getting into the soil, which can harm the microbes that keep the soil healthy. This might make the soil less productive and lead to using more fertilizers.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since mulch helps <strong>reduce water usage</strong> and weeds, it’s important for us to keep using it, especially in a developing country like ours. However, I’m concerned about the <strong>plastic waste</strong> it creates, so I’m looking for solutions. I’ve thought of a few ideas, and I’d love to collaborate if you have any thoughts on how they could be implemented: </p>
                    <p>1. <strong>Natural Foliage Mulch:</strong> Although using natural foliage as mulch is effective, collecting and spreading it can be difficult. I’m thinking about collecting this material and turning it into sheets that can be easily laid in the field.</p>
                    <p>2. <strong>Biodegradable Paper Mulch:</strong> Another idea is to coat craft paper with vegetable oil and cure it to make it into a water-resistant, degradable polymer. This paper could then be used as mulch.</p>

                <h2>A Thought-Provoking Start: Exploring "What is a Computer?" with Young Minds</h2>
                <p>Posted on <time datetime="2022-01-30">January 30, 2022</time></p>
                    <p>The first day of teaching at Z. P. Primary School was an exciting one. I had planned to start with the CM1 module of the curriculum. Since attendance was low in the 7th class, I decided to introduce concepts gradually to avoid repeating lessons for absent students.</p>
    
    		    <p>As I began the session with the question, "What is a computer?", I expected either silence or vague responses. However, one girl confidently answered, "A computer is an electronic device that takes input and gives output." Her precise definition surprised me and altered the direction of my lesson. My new challenge was to help her and the other students truly understand what the definition meant.</p>
    
    		    <p>According to my lesson plan, I aimed to cover four key aspects:</p>
    			<ul>
        			<li>A computer is an electronic device.</li>
        			<li>It works with information (input and output).</li>
        			<li>It helps solve problems.</li>
        			<li>It exists in various forms beyond office settings.</li>
    			</ul>
    			<!--/span><strong>[read more]</strong>

&nbsp;-->
    		   <p>The class engaged actively in discussions, and most students grasped the fundamental concept of a computer. To reinforce their understanding, I posed a question: "Is a digital weighing machine a computer?" After a brief discussion, most students agreed that it utilizes a computer to function. This marked a good stopping point for the day.</p>
    
    		   <p>During the discussion, I emphasized that a computer processes information, handles input and output, and aids in problem-solving. Later, after interacting with her classmates, the same girl returned with a compelling question: "Is a human a computer?" She argued that humans also process information, take input and give output, and solve problems. Her curiosity sparked further debate, and I encouraged the class to think it over.</p>
    
    		   <p>On another day, when the absent students returned, she eagerly steered the session back to her question. We spent half an hour debating whether humans could be considered computers. Some students argued that computers cannot move, so I showed them a video of Boston Dynamics robots dancing. Others said that humans do not run on electricity, so I asked them to consider energy in broader terms—just as computers use electrical energy, humans derive energy from food.</p>
    
    		   <p>One student finally noted a crucial distinction: "We have will and desire, but computers don’t." That moment became a natural pause in the discussion, and we returned to our planned lesson.</p>
    
     		   <p>Even now, the question remains open for them to explore. Apart from will and desire, the students continue searching for more differences between humans and computers. This unplanned philosophical inquiry turned out to be an enriching experience, highlighting how curiosity can drive deep learning.</p>
    
    		   <p><strong>Teaching is not just about delivering content—it is about encouraging students to think, question, and seek answers beyond the obvious. And sometimes, the best lessons come from the questions we never expected.</strong></p>

                <h2>Can you find the penumbral shadow?</h2>
                <p>Posted on <time datetime="2020-01-02">January 02, 2020</time></p>
                <p> I captured a video using a mobile phone and an 8-inch telescope of a partial penumbral lunar eclipse.</p>
                <p>Don't be discouraged if you can't see the shadow. I might not have captured it perfectly. However, you will notice that the moon appears to rotate in the video. You might wonder, does the moon rotate like that? The short answer is no. In reality, the moon wobbles a little but doesn't rotate as seen in the video. The rotation in the video is due to the type of telescope mount we used—a Dobsonian mount. When the object we're observing passes the zenith (the point directly overhead), we have to adjust our viewing direction. This adjustment causes the frame of our recording device, which is attached to the telescope, to rotate.</p>

                <p>Here's a presentation I made for my class on atmospheric science, which I studied during my master's program. I chose this topic because I enjoy photographing and observing different types of clouds. Clouds can reveal important clues for predicting the weather. Additionally, I'm interested in folktales related to clouds. If you know of any, please let me know!</p>
